Creational Design Patterns:
    Builder
    Factories
    Prototype
    Signlton

Structural Design Patterns:
    Adapters
    Bridge
    Composite
    Decorator
    Facade - Exposing several components through a single interface
    Flyweight - space optimization: Avoid redundancy when storing data
    Proxy - An interface for accessing a particular resource. A class that
            functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource
            may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or
            some other added functionality.

    Proxy VS Decorator - Proxy provides an identical interface; decorator provides enhanced interface;
                         Decorator typically aggregates (or has reference to) what is decorating;
                         proxy doesn't have to do

    Chain of Responsibility - Sequence of handlers processing an event one after one

    CQS (CQRS) - Command Query Separation. Command - asking for an action or change
                 Query - asking for info.

    Command - want an object that represents an operation. Then can save commands
              sequences or undo them.
